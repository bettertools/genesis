# OpenSSL on Windows

This is how I got openssl to work on windows.

* Download binaries from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

I downloaded this 64-bit exe installer https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_1_1g.exe

* Run the installer
    - Pick an install location
    - I selected "Copy OpenSSL Dlls to:" > "The OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory" but it shouldn't matter
